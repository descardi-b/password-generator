# 🌸 welcome to my password generator! 🌸 

here's a random password generator developed as part of the UC Berkeley Full Stack Development bootcamp curriculum. <br /><br />

in this assignment, i was tasked with:
<br /><br />

🍓 creating a function to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters in length <br />
🍓 prompting options to include special, numerical, uppercase, and lowercase characters <br />
🍓 operationalizing the generate password button with html and javascript so that it creates and displays the random password as text on the page <br /><br />

here are some screenshots of my work:
